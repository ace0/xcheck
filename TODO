TODO

- Permutation tests
- Hashing tests
- Encryption tests

- Generate fresh key that is not in the commit history
- Update readme with new quickstart
- Update readme with new explainer




Review later:

- Split upload/registry commands
- Remove PRFsecret -- switch 
- cli: process -- Add decryption
- Add settings.json with default settings
- SFTP transfer functions
- cli: upload

- Add xcheck python API 
- Add instructions for python API in README

- Add sensitive files to .gitignore (.prfsecret, *-private.pem)

- Automatically detect number of CPUs and fan out the computation

- Reorganize? 
-- crypto.py -- encryption and low-level tools
-- registry.py  -- registry-related operations: loadRegistry, updateRegistry
-- xcheck.py -- CLI and API?
-- match.py -- perform matching 
-- Or: put all into one file. xheck.py with CLI and all operations?

- Some entries mix file and file contents. Need to standardize
- PubkeyEnc/Dec need to take contents-not-files and maybe add a wrapper that
  operates on files-not-contents
